# advent-of-code-2023
The contents of this repository are my attempts at the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge. I'm going to try to spice things up by varying my choice of language regularly—though it's going to be mostly C, C++, Python, and Haskell.

## Languages used for each day, and number of stars earned
1. **C** (⭐⭐)
2. **C++** (⭐⭐)
3. **C++** _(no stars so far—still a WIP)_
   * first attempted with Haskell, but abandoned due to the headache of not having loop indices or mutable data for this particular problem
4. **Python** (⭐⭐)
