# advent-of-code-2023
The contents of this repository are my attempts at the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge. I'm going to try to spice things up by varying my choice of language regularly—though it's going to be mostly C, C++, Python, and Haskell.

## Languages used for each day, number of stars earned, and date completed
1. **C** (⭐⭐) — Dec 9, 2023
2. **C++** (⭐⭐) — Dec 11, 2023
3. **C++** (⭐⭐) — Dec 14, 2023
4. **Python** (⭐⭐) — Dec 12, 2023
5. **Python** (⭐⭐) — _(Part I)_ Dec 13, 2023; _(Part II)_ Dec 14, 2023
6. **Haskell** (⭐⭐) — Dec 14, 2023
   * later re-done in **NASM x86-64** — Dec 20, 2023
7. **Python** (⭐) — _(Part I)_ Dec 14, 2023
8. **C++** (⭐⭐) — Dec 18, 2023
9. **C** (⭐⭐) — Dec 21, 2023
10. **C++** (⭐) — _(Part I)_ Dec 22, 2023

## Notes
* Day 3 was first attempted with Haskell, but abandoned due to the headache of not having loop indices or mutable data for this particular problem. Thankfully, C++ was much better suited to the task at hand.
