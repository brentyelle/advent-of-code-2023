# advent-of-code-2023
The contents of this repository are my attempts at the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge. I have tried to spice things up by alternating between the C, C++, Python, and Haskell. If on the off chance there is a challenge that I feel I can do expediently in x86-64 ASM, I *might* attempt that, but I'm not counting on it.

## Languages used for each day, and number of stars earned
1. C (⭐⭐)
2. C++ (⭐⭐)
3. first attempted with Haskell, then with C++ (no stars so far--still a WIP)
4. Python (⭐⭐)
